# AudioStreaming
an app i created to stream my music to a device without having the music there. also a project i made to get my hands dirty with C#

the project uses:

.NET 4.5
Naudio : audio backbone
Lz4.Net : compression of the raw PCM data when not in MP3 mode. to be changed in the future when i compress that PCM to MP3 somehow
